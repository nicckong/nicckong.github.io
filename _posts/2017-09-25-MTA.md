title: MTA Turnstile Data Analysis
---

<h1>Optimal Placement of Street Teams at Entrances of Subway Stations</h1>

<p> This is my first project at <a href = 'https://www.thisismetis.com'>Metis</a>. We were given 4 days to analysis the turnstile data from MTA, source additional data that can help us giving recommendation to WomenTechWomeanWhy (WTWY) on which subway station(s) they should place their volunteers to attract attendees to its upcoming annual gala dinner. 

<h2>Background information about WTWY gala dinner</h2>
WTWY has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. They try to do double duty with the gala both to fill the event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

Email addresses are colelected by street teams at entrances to subway stations and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
In summary, we recognised that WTWY wants to :  
1) build awareness and reach out to women in technology  
2) raise money at the gala dinner

We, therefore, thought that we could also examine the income and tech company distributions. 

We decided to use the MTA subway data to identify list of stations with most traffic (i.e. stations that we can potnentailly get most signatures), then use the income and tech company data to narrow down the list with highest potential attendees and donations. We also further looked at the best day of the week and time of the day for the volunteers. 

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<a href = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'>MTA Turnstile Data</a>  
<a href = ''>Income by Zip Code</a>  
<a href = ''>NYC Tech Company Start Up</a>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>People are in a rush while getting into the stations, therefore, we would focus on exits intead of entries</li>
	<li>People with higher income are morely likely to donate</li>
	<li>Large tech companies are likely to support WTWY</li>

</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Total exit counts 25% less than total entry counts</li>
	<li>Traffic for weekdays are significantly more than weekends</li>
	<li>Top exit stations vary, depending time of the day</li>

</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
We decided to have 2 different strategies for weekdays mornings and evenings to target different auidence:
